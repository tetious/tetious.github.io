    <h1 class="title"> Android is Insecure By Design </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>Android&rsquo;s security situation is pretty dire. Considering how well Google architected Chrome, I know they understand how to create a secure system. Perhaps Google don&rsquo;t care about security on Android? If a user needs to worry about downloading malware on Android Market, which has apps that leak or maliciously steal personal data, and others that send spam SMS messages, among other nasty things, something has gone terribly wrong. Asking users to review a complex and obtuse permissions list is not even close to the answer. Time and time again, we&rsquo;ve seen that this sort of thing can&rsquo;t be left to the users by default. They will always click yes. Google has not learned this lesson, obviously, and as such, I expect the Android platform will turn into the Windows of old, where nearly every smartphone is jam-packed with Spy/Malware. Hopefully I&rsquo;m wrong and Google will wake up.</p>
