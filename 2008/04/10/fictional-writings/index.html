    <h1 class="title"> Fictional Writings </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>And I mean writing that doesn&rsquo;t exist, not writing about things that don&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m working on what feels like a novel, perhaps of slightly shorter than what would be considered a big book, but not so short as to not fall into the novel category. It also seems to want to be a young adult book, through it wasn&rsquo;t one when it was still rattling around in the cobwebs of my lack-of-brain.</p>

<p>That it exists in its unfinished form means that it isn&rsquo;t fictional. However it hasn&rsquo;t gelled sufficiently that I have more than a vague sense where the hell it is going. This frustrates me, and makes me wonder if it exists anywhere other than the vague shimmering of characters and ideas. Not that I have much experience to go on here; maybe this is how The Process always feels.</p>

<p>I do manage to write between a few hundred and a thousand words a day, but it just isn&rsquo;t <strong>going</strong> anywhere. My silly characters are muttering to themselves and aren&rsquo;t getting together like I&rsquo;d planned. The BIG HONKING event that starts things off doesn&rsquo;t want to happen.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s where I am and I&rsquo;ll keep you informed about where I go from here. This ramble brought to you by Debbie, blog secretary extraordinaire.</p>
