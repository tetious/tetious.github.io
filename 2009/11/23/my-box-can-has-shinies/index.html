<p>I think of my inner world like a child holding a box of their most precious treasures and when they show it to someone the person laughs and teases that that they aren&rsquo;t treasures, they are worthless knickknacks and stones. What hurts isn&rsquo;t being told that they are worthless, what hurts is that something so wonderful could not be shared. What doesn&rsquo;t do any good is locking the box up and showing no one ever again. You have to learn to show someone else and keep doing it until you find someone who appreciates it just as you do.</p>
