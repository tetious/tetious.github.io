    <div class="content"> <p>I picked up two highly spiffy games today. Star Ocean: Till the End of Time and Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne. Both are highly excellent. Star Ocean features lots of excellent voice acting, and some amazing character animation, the likes of which I&rsquo;ve not seen since Kingdom Hearts. It also has some excellent fully orchestrated music and a great start at a fairly predictable but interesting story. The translation seems to be top notch, and lacks the odd dialog elements that some of Square&rsquo;s stuff has had in the past. Shin Megami clearly lacks the budget and flash of Star Ocean, but it makes up for that with style. It sports some very flashy cell shaded graphics, and a fairly unique soundtrack that has lots of electric guitar and pipe organ fun. No voice acting so far, but the story is highly unique which should make for a great play, and the translation is pretty good, but not perfect and not as polished as Star Ocean&rsquo;s. Now I just have to figure out which to play through first. I really ought to limit myself to one game purchase at a time.</p>
