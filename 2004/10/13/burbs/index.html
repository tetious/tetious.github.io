    <h1 class="title"> &#39;Burbs </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>Just watched one of my favorite movies: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096734/">The &lsquo;Burbs</a>. It has a great Jerry Goldsmith score and an excellent cast. I also think it might be Joe Dante&rsquo;s best work, although I really liked Innerspace and Gremlins. It certainly is the funniest, in my oh so humble opinion. Dante seems to like to reuse cast. Dick Miller and Corey Feldman were both in Gremlins, and Dick Miller and Robert Picardo were both in Innerspace. They also were all scored by Goldsmith.Â Gremlins is another excellent score of his if you are collecting. If you&rsquo;ve not seen The &lsquo;Burbs, I highly recommend giving it a rent. Be sure you get it in widescreen though, as it has some fantastic framing and some long takes that just don&rsquo;t work at all in 4:3.</p>
