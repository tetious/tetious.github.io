    <div class="content"> <p>If you are curious, you can have a look at the stats for Zidane and the box&rsquo;s current load and uptime at the page I finally took the time to update and get working again. Heh.  <a href="http://greglincoln.com/server/uptime.php">http://greglincoln.com/server/uptime.php</a> Uptime is pretty embarrasing recently. I think Rocket was over 100 days when he finally went to the big rack in the sky, but his all time record was over 200 days. Until the end, Rocket was rock solid. Zidane averages about 25-30 days between hard-locks. Sigh.</p>
