    <h1 class="title"> Happy Christmas </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>I swear I posted this yesterday. Either I dreamed I did, or I hallucinated it as it isn&rsquo;t here. Perhaps LJ ate it. Anyway, I hope everyone had a great Christmas. I was only half awake all day because Zidane picked Christmas Eve to decide he wasn&rsquo;t going to use that old broken RAM anymore. So Brian and I scrambled and fought to get it replaced, and just before midnight we succeeded. And then I slept late, but poorly. Then I woke in a truly foul mood, which I think I successfully hid as nobody mentioned it. ;) Today I&rsquo;m off to eat with my folks and then I might pick up World of Warcraft. Have a great day!</p>
