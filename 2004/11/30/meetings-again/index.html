    <h1 class="title"> meetings again </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>Yesterday I had the first meeting from Helen&rsquo;s room scheduled for this week. Tomorrow I have the one I am dreading the most.</p>

<p>Even worse, due to yesterday being an OFIM to remember, with problems and deadlines distracting me all morning, I was **late **to the meeting. And since I ran up several flights of stairs and all around the floor trying to find the room, I was very frazzled and out of breath when I finally made it. I just love Mondays.</p>

<p>Now for some</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still very pleased, and I&rsquo;m learning my way around more every day. I&rsquo;m starting to find solid replacements for many of the applications I used on a daily basis. Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve settled on at the moment, but if you know me at all, you&rsquo;ll know this is subject to change on a daily basis.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve switched from Firefox to Safari. Safari just feels faster, and is very well integrated, but it does lack a couple features which I miss, like tab session saving.</p>

<p>For mail, I&rsquo;ve switched from Thunderbird to Mail.app. Mail.app is probably the best mail client I&rsquo;ve ever used. It has everything I liked about Thunderbird, and many things I now can&rsquo;t live without, like inline spell checking.</p>

<p>Itunes has replaced XMMS and/or Winamp very effectively. I did miss the many plugins I&rsquo;d found for winamp and XMMS over the years, but I&rsquo;ve found Quicktime components for many of them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently using Adium for IM, but I&rsquo;m looking around for an alternative, mainly because of bugs like filesending not working and occasional crashes. iChat is close, but it doesn&rsquo;t support YIM, and has a really a poor conversation logger.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still looking for a good usenet client. Unison is pretty good, and I might end up going with it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been playing with Konfabulator, which is quickly becoming an app I can&rsquo;t live without. It fills in all the gaps and reminds me of Desktop X from Stardock, only much more cleanly implemented.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve bored you to tears with that list of software and Mac rambling. That should qualify for my villainous deed for today. I hope everyone has a GREAT day. Thanks for reading!</p>
