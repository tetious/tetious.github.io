    <h1 class="title"> Yay for iPods </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>So I picked up an iPod over the weekend, after much research and deliberation. (hearing the virtues first hand from Â put me over the edge)</p>

<p>After using it a couple days now I&rsquo;m very impressed. The iTunes integration is seamless and fast, and I was able to copy my gigantic nearly 100% (I have some out of print stuff I can&rsquo;t find) legal 31G music collection over in about 40 minutes. Subsequent syncs to update play count/times etc take only a minute or two.</p>

<p>I also bought an album from the music store, and that was a great experience as well. I have had some stability problems with iTunes, which I&rsquo;m fairly sure are because of my elcheapo AOpen CDR drive. iTunes will just freeze up if I try to rip a CD or burn something. When I remove that drive, all is well and my DVD/CDRW combo drive is faster anyway so I suppose I&rsquo;ll just give the AOpen away.</p>

<p>I really like the Smart Playlist feature, and the party shuffle. That is a great way to discover songs in my 9000+ track collection that I&rsquo;ve forgotten about.</p>

<p>In other news, Veronica Mars was picked up for a full season, which is great news. This show reminds me of both Buffy and Alias, and I&rsquo;m really enjoying it. You might check it out if that description sounds interesting to you. It is on tonight at 9pm eastern on UPN.</p>

<p>In other other news, Halflife 2 is finally out! I haven&rsquo;t had time to play it yet but it sounds GREAT. I just need to KEEP THE ZOMBIES AWAY WITH MY WALLPAPERED COKE. POMG.</p>
