    <h1 class="title"> FRIDAY </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>Yes, it is friday. About bloody time. This week sure dragged on and on and on and on.</p>

<p>Halflife 2 is really great. After looking forward to the game all this time, it is nice to be able to finally play it. But it is even nicer that the game is of such amazingly high quality. The first few hours of gameplay have been the most fun I can ever remember having playing a game.</p>

<p>Racing around in the canals on that hovercraft/air boat was such a blast. I&rsquo;m not that far into it yet because it made me get motion-sick for the first time ever. (and the second time last night) I&rsquo;ve played oodles of 3d games, spent thousands of hours on boats, and never had a moment of trouble. For whatever reason, Halflife 2 makes me motion-sick. It just isn&rsquo;t fair.</p>

<p>Oh, and it has ZOMBIES, so be sure to DRINK COKE.</p>

<p>In other news, I seem to be getting passed around from project to project at work. It is starting to make me dizzy. I suppose it could be worse. I could so little to do that I have time to be on a committie. That would be frightening, although I don&rsquo;t know for whom.</p>

<p>I need some icons. Everyone on my friends list has more interesting icons than I do. I feel left out. Happy Friday! *falls asleep*</p>
