      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m certainly not going to run out of things to learn about electronics. Anytime I start exploring something new, it leads to a bunch of combined feelings that mix up into a frothing mass. Excitement at gaining better understanding, and the general love of learning. Distress wondering if some things are ever going to make sense, or if I lack the fundamental bits I need to figure them out. (like Hard Math&amp;trade;) Sleepiness, from too many late nights fiddling.</description>

      <title>Debugging Success!</title>

      <description>Yesterday I mentioned I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to get debugging going with JTAG and my STM32 dev board. I puzzled it out today, and it was a definite PEBKAC. Alas. In the hopes that it may help someone, I&amp;rsquo;ll share my results here.
The key is a &amp;ldquo;make it work&amp;rdquo; setting within CubeMX. By default, the JTAG pins are not configured! This is probably obvious to folks used to working with this platform.</description>

      <description>The Prelude The STM32 has garnered some attention lately as a possible successor/upgrade for the limited AVR microcontrollers that most Arduinos use. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why it has captured the spotlight away from other interesting options, such as the Freescale part used in the Teensy. Perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s only my perception. There is certainly room enough for multiple nifty alternatives.
As is common, the place to go for cheap and cheerful if slightly dodgy electronical goodness is Banggood.</description>
