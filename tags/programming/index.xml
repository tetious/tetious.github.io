      <description>Have you ever wished your dictionary of &amp;lt;K,V&amp;gt; was in fact of &amp;lt;V,K&amp;gt;? I might be the last person to figure this out, but with LINQ (and a couple lambdas) you can do this with one magical line of code:
var newDict = oldDict.ToDictionary(l =&amp;gt; l.Value, l =&amp;gt; l.Key);  Neat, eh?</description>

      <title>Become a Jedi with Resharper</title>

      <description>If you work in C# or VB.net on a regular basis, you really owe it to yourself to try out Resharper. This tool saves me countless hours.
James Kovacs put together some fantastic screencasts on &amp;ldquo; Becoming a Jedi&amp;rdquo; that show it in action, if you are curious.
He hasn&amp;rsquo;t covered the features that make it a boon for test driven development yet, but there&amp;rsquo;s another great screencast that shows that off, and this post provides some additional details on &amp;ldquo;coding in reverse&amp;rdquo; with Resharper.</description>

      <title>Order of operations</title>

      <description>Sometimes I can be such a buffoon. When programming with threads, one must be sure to lock and unlock in the correct order. Also, one must be sure not to do things explicitly marked as no-nos while in a &amp;ldquo;critical section.&amp;rdquo;
I just lost two hours to this, so I felt the need to whine.</description>

      <title>On programming for fun.</title>
      <link>/2007/02/17/on-programming-for-fun/</link>

      <description>I wonder if it is the nature of the beast that when someone does something for a living day in and day out, it stops being fun. I&amp;rsquo;m starting to worry that may be the case with me.
Why am I bringing this up? One reason is due to watching my friend Rab having fun with Python. He&amp;rsquo;s having fun. He&amp;rsquo;s doing it for fun, and thus he&amp;rsquo;s having fun. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t that sound like fun?</description>
