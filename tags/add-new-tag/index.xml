      <description>And I mean writing that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, not writing about things that don&amp;rsquo;t exist.
So I&amp;rsquo;m working on what feels like a novel, perhaps of slightly shorter than what would be considered a big book, but not so short as to not fall into the novel category. It also seems to want to be a young adult book, through it wasn&amp;rsquo;t one when it was still rattling around in the cobwebs of my lack-of-brain.</description>
