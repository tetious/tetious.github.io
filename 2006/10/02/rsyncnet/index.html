    <div class="content"> <p>We needed offsite backup at the dayjob, and after some research, I went with <a href="http://www.rsync.net">rsync.net</a>. Their support is above and beyond what I expected. I had a small problem with their payment form, and they responded very quickly to my email and even set up the account anyway while they worked on the payment issue. These guys get it and are great to work with. They also provide very easy and secure access in several ways including ssh,ftp and dav. Ssh means you can do some really cool things. For example, using the magic of FUSE, I&rsquo;ve set up an encrypted filesystem over sshfs. Performance is surprisingly good, and I can use rsync via the local mount point while still having the benefits of encryption. If you need offsite backup, you really should check these guys out.</p>
