    <div class="content"> <p>For some reason, I&rsquo;ve been feeling the urge to give World of Warcraft another try. As I still have the game installed on the Windows PC, it tempts me from time to time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve quit twice after playing a short time each instance. I just couldn&rsquo;t get into it. But with Jerry Pournelle mentioning it all the time, and that damned icon on the gaming machine, it is just so tempting.</p>

<p>Oh well. It only costs 15 dollars to see if anything has changed that will capture my fancy. Now that I&rsquo;ve finished justifying it to myself, I guess I&rsquo;ll reactivate my account. ;)</p>

<p>Oh and by the way, did I mention I got a nice new MacBook? I was offered one for a price I couldn&rsquo;t refuse. I guess I&rsquo;ll be sending back the Dell that replaced my iBook for a few days. It wasn&rsquo;t a bad machine, but I sure missed OS X.</p>
