    <div class="content"> <p>Monday. Oh, how I hate thee. Rotten to the crunchy center art thou. For some reason, I feel like I didn&rsquo;t get any sleep last night. I know I did though. I even had some bizarre dreams. I don&rsquo;t usually get those on weekdays. My theory is that I don&rsquo;t sleep long enough to allow REM sleep on weekdays. My subconscious refuses to be ignored even in those cases. I get all the wacky dreams come the weekend. Saturday morning is always wacky and adventure filled. I wonder if this is common for folks who don&rsquo;t get enough sleep during the week. Once, I dreamed that I was dreaming that I was dreaming. I woke up twice into a complete reality that was my own, only it wasn&rsquo;t. In that way that only dreams can. I&rsquo;ve only had that happen once, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever forget it. It may be the oddest and most lucid dream I&rsquo;ve had thus far. In geeky news, I discovered <a href="http://www.rsync.net">rsync.net</a> over the weekend. We&rsquo;ve been looking for offsite backup at the dayjob, and this looks to be a good fit. The price is a bargain, and I get to use rsync. Together with one of the FUSE encrypted filesystems, I should be able to use all the power of rsync and have a nice safe encrypted offsite backup.</p>
